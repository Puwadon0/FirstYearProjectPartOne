## 🧩 Framework Route Standard Example

Example (Flask Blueprint):

```python
from flask import Blueprint

auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__)

@auth_bp.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    return {"message": "Login successful"}
```

In `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask
from routes.auth_routes import auth_bp

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(auth_bp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
